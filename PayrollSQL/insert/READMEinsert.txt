insert

Insert values in table in this order - company, department, employee, performance, payout, salary, leavep, tax, attendance, benefits.

Some values in some attributes that are auto-incremented such as Company_ID in table company go from Company_ID = 2 to Company_ID = 5
becuase I had to delete some values and did not want to reset auto increment becuase I found it unnecessary.
